## Architecture

The client consists of several key components:

1. **JWT Authentication** (`auth.py`): Handles JWT token generation for MCP server authentication
2. **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`): Async HTTP client with SSE support for MCP protocol communication
3. **Mapbox Agent** (`mapbox_agent.py`): Pydantic-AI agent with integrated Mapbox tools
4. **CLI Interface** (`cli.py`): Interactive command-line interface with rich formatting

## Available Tools

The agent has access to the following Mapbox MCP tools:

### Geocoding Tools

- **forward_geocode**: Convert addresses to coordinates
  - Example: "What are the coordinates of the Empire State Building?"
- **reverse_geocode**: Convert coordinates to addresses
  - Example: "What's at longitude -77.036, latitude 38.895?"

### Search Tools

- **search_poi**: Search for points of interest
  - Example: "Find Italian restaurants near Union Square, San Francisco"
  - Supports proximity search with radius

### Navigation Tools

- **get_directions**: Get turn-by-turn directions
  - Supports multiple profiles: driving, walking, cycling
  - Example: "Get directions from LAX to Hollywood"
- **calculate_matrix**: Compute travel time/distance matrices
  - Example: "Calculate travel times between multiple locations"

### Visualization Tools

- **create_static_map**: Generate static map images
  - Customizable size, zoom, and style
  - Support for markers
  - Example: "Show me a map of Central Park"
- **get_isochrone**: Calculate reachable areas within time limits
  - Example: "What areas can I reach in 15 minutes driving from downtown?"

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used

- **Pydantic-AI**: Agent framework with structured outputs and tool integration
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for API communication
- **httpx-sse**: Server-sent events support for streaming responses
- **PyJWT**: JWT token generation and validation
- **Typer**: Modern CLI framework
- **Rich**: Beautiful terminal formatting
- **Logfire**: Observability and distributed tracing

### Key Features

- **Async/Await**: Fully asynchronous implementation for better performance
- **Structured Outputs**: Type-safe responses using Pydantic models
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure communication with the MCP server
- **Context Management**: Proper resource cleanup with async context managers

## Logging and Observability

The client uses Logfire for comprehensive logging:

- All HTTP requests are instrumented with spans
- Tool executions are tracked with detailed metrics
- Errors are logged with full context and tracebacks
- Performance metrics are captured for each operation
- Distributed tracing across client and server

To view logs in the Logfire cloud dashboard, set your `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test suites
uv run pytest tests/integration -v  # Integration tests only
uv run pytest tests/agent -v        # Agent tests only

# Run specific test files
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_auth.py -v
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_mcp_connection.py -v
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Type checking
uv run mypy src

# Linting
uv run ruff check src tests examples

# Formatting
uv run ruff format src tests examples
```

### Testing Against Local MCP Server

1. Start the MCP server locally:

   ```bash
   cd ../  # Go to mapbox-mcp-server root
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Ensure your `.env` file points to localhost:

   ```
   MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   uv run cli "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"
   ```

### Manual Usage (Without UV)

If you prefer not to use UV, you can activate the virtual environment manually:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run CLI
python -m src.cli

# Run examples
python examples/basic_geocoding.py

# Run tests
pytest -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized)

**Important:** If you're getting "The token signature is invalid" errors:

- Check if `JWT_SECRET` is set as an environment variable: `echo $JWT_SECRET`
- If it exists and is truncated (missing trailing `==`), unset it: `unset JWT_SECRET`
- Both the server and client must use the same JWT_SECRET from `.env` files
- The JWT_SECRET should be 87-88 characters long and end with `==`

General troubleshooting:

- Ensure your `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` matches the one used by the MCP server
- Check that the `MCP_SERVER_URL` is correct and accessible
- Verify the JWT token is being generated correctly using `uv run python -m src.auth`

### API Errors

- Verify your Mapbox access token is valid and has the necessary scopes
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Check rate limits for both services

### Tool Execution Errors

- If you see "JSON-RPC error", check the tool arguments format
- Ensure coordinates are in [longitude, latitude] order
- Verify all required parameters are provided

### Connection Issues

- The MCP server must be running and accessible
- For local development, ensure the server is running on the configured port
- Check your internet connection for external APIs
- Verify firewall settings allow HTTP/HTTPS connections

### Logfire Issues

- If Logfire is not working, ensure your `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` is valid
- Check that the token has the correct permissions
- You can disable Logfire by removing the token from `.env`
